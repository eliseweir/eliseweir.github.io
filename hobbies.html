        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        I really enjoy playing board games. During my free time, I can often be found playing Race
        for the Galaxy or Carcassonne with my sister and brother-in-law on
        <a href="https://www.boardgamearena.com">Board Game Arena</a>. When I get the chance, I also like
        to play Gloomhaven, Agricola, Dominion, Trivial Pursuit, Power Grid, Jaipur, and Azul.<br><br>

        I'm also a fan of video games. I'm currently playing Red Dead Redemption 2. Some of my other favorites
        are Breath of the Wild (and most other Zelda games), Fallout 4, Skyrim, Horizon Zero Dawn, Witcher 3,
        Outer Worlds, and Mario games. My favorite Mario Kart is the Wii version (controversial!).
        Guitar Hero and Jackbox games are also loads of fun.<br><br>

        I spend a lot of time listening to podcasts. My hands-down favorite is Reply All, but I also recommend
        The Adventure Zone, Radiolab, More Perfect, Invisibilia, Nancy, Playing for Fun, and Science VS.<br><br>

        When the weather allows, I can be found taking a walk in the park and enjoying the trees and local wildlife. I haven't played
        in a while, but I enjoy badminton and soccer as well.
